    <h2>Where it Began&mdash;</h2>
    <br>
    <p>My first significant brush with technology came about unexpectedly whilst starting a new job at a marketing agency that I quickly learned was in fact a technology company specialising in Marketing Tech&mdash;a sector I wasn’t even aware of in my green and growing years. With the company providing a fully-automated end-to-end marketing service, I was required to demonstrate a nuanced understanding of various internal and EAS software, maintain active involvement in growth and scale endeavours, develop marketing stack architecture, formulate/adapt products concurrent with emerging technologies, as well as work closely with developers and IT specialists (without whom the aforementioned would not be possible). I certainly got more than I bargained for but the simple misinterpretation of a recruitment ad facilitated valuable insights into some of the applications of information technology that perhaps a more executional marketing position would not have afforded and I feel fortunate to have stumbled into the world of technology as a result.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Interest in IT&mdash;</h2>
    <br>
    <p>As my background demonstrates, my interest in IT revolves around enhancing the way we do business and interface with the world. In particular, exploring the intersect between information technology and traditionally low-tech fields that rely on less sophisticated methods to operate. Art, Design, Psychology, Health & Wellness, and Sexual Education are all areas that are important to me and while I don’t have plans to further my education in these fields, the possibility of exploring their convergence with emerging technologies is something that excites me&mdash;I’d love to play a role in increasing the accessibility and interoperability of these spaces in some way throughout the course of my career in IT. By developing my skills in various programming languages (Java, Dart, C++), learning how to use collaborative project management tools such as Jira, understanding integrated development environments such as Intelij, and leaning on resources such as Stack Overflow, I hope to be involved in developing valuable applications that enhance the way users interact with products, systems, and services.
    As a graduate, I will have acquired the techniques and methodologies fundamental to forging a career in IT and remaining agile in an ever-evolving landscape. Web & application design, programming, project management, troubleshooting, and ethical hacking are some of the hard skills I expect to attain throughout the degree, as well as problem-solving, adaptability, critical thinking, teamwork, communication, and more.

  <h2>Ideal Job&mdash;</h2>

  <h3><b><a href="https://cryptojobslist.com/jobs/project-manager-web3-marketplace-at-minty-art-remote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Manager at Minty Art</b></a></h3>
  <br>

  <p>This position demands strong communication and organisational skills in order to manage projects from ideation to completion, requiring the incumbent to coordinate staff, resources and technologies in order to deliver. </p>
  <p>In addition to setting timelines and ensuring deliverables are met, the position necessitates influential leadership skills that build relationships with each member of the project team in a manner that nurtures their strengths and empowers them to succeed. This role represents an opportunity for me to demonstrate my management and problem-solving skills in a field that I’m excited about.
  </p>
  <p>Being an advocate for democratising the art world, as well as having a keen interest in blockchain technology/NFTs and the opportunities they present for the art ecosystem, this feels like the perfect position for me to flourish in. As my psychometric diagnostics demonstrate, and as I can personally attest, it is imperative for me to work in fields that align with my personal values, and this position more than fulfills that need.</p>

  <br><br>
  <p>Project Management positions traditionally demand analysis expertise and an understanding of the effort, cost, and scope of a given project. This position in particular requires a strong grasp of budgeting, planning, and management best practices, and thus general business acumen is valuable, as well as a comprehensive understanding of blockchain technology, token economy, NFTs, decentralised finance, and their implications. The job description calls for excellent verbal and written communication skills and experience with various communication and collaborative organisational tools. The successful candidate will preferably hold a relevant Bachelor's degree or adequate experience in the field.
  Having worked in project lead and managerial roles previously, I understand the fundamental principles required to coordinate a team successfully with key milestones in mind. I have extensive experience with Asana, Hubspot and Discord as stipulated in the advertisement, as well as communicating with key stakeholders within the tech space. My comprehension of blockchain technology is developing with plenty of room for improvement&mdash;this is an area I’m researching and applying on a regular basis.</p>
  <p>In order to succeed in this role, I plan to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT and continue to develop my knowledge in the crypto space by taking courses and applying my learning in real-world scenarios. This may require me to take on internships to gain hands-on experience working with NFTs and digital art curators. In addition, I’ll need to take steps in understanding Web3 infrastructure which will require thorough reading and discussions with experts.
