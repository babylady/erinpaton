      <h1>SELF SRVCE&trade;<h1>
      <br>
      <p>SELF SRVCE is a web-based subscription application facilitating the sale of regular digital content to subscribers, with the option for creators to mint and sell one-off digital items as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/nft/#what-are-nfts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a>. With a strong emphasis on advocating for a shift in cultural norms around sex positivity, the platform aims to provide a safe and profitable environment for sex workers (SW), adult entertainers, and cam models to connect with their fans and share their content securely. Cognisant of the barriers to accepting traditional payments for sexually-oriented services, all one-off transactions can be made in cryptocurrency rather than traditional fiat with a view to moving recurring payments entirely to crypto as technology in this area develops. </p>
    <br>
      <h2>Motivation&mdash;</h2>
      <br>
      <p>SELF SRVCE recognises that the right for SWs to express themselves with autonomy remains under duress globally (Amnesty International 2015). As banks (SBS News 2019) and mainstream payment processors continue to disenchfranchise SWs by severing ties with popular sites and refusing to process payments (Business Insider 2019), SELF SRVCE sees a growing need for innovation in the adult entertainment space that will allow creators to continue to make a living. COVID-19 has undoubtedly impacted consumer habits and significantly augmented the subscription-based economy (Tzuo 2020) and with the subsequent rise in popularity of virtual content, SELF SRVCE has identified an opportunity to meet the growing demands of online users and the needs of creators alike. Whilst supporting the adult industry is a key driver, SELF SRVCE is an inclusive community and is accessible to anyone over 18 looking to trade their digital content for cryptocurrency, from educational courses to live-streams, to selfies.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h2>Description&mdash;</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Subscription fees and content frequency are customised at the creator-level, with the option for creators to accept payments on a monthly or yearly basis. Monthly recurring payments are processed in fiat, while the yearly up-front payment option can be accepted in cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum), enabling users to expand their crypto portfolio whilst growing their fan base. Seamless integration with Stripe allows no-fuss recurring payments with the platform automatically responding to payment defaults using customisable triggers so creators can spend less time chasing payments and more time producing valuable content. SELF SRVCE’s integrated email marketing tools enable creators to send one-off blasts to push new and soon-to-be-released products, send rewards and promotions to their fans, and set up conditional email sequences based on their subscriber’s activity to keep their audience informed and engaged. Additional features include paid conversations with individual subscribers and one on one content sharing, allowing users to monetise bespoke experiences in addition to their core service and foster closer connections with their fans.
      </p>
      <p>Each user creates their own personal profile, publicising as much or as little basic information as they wish, with options to display preferred <a href="https://genderminorities.com/database/glossary-transgender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pronouns, gender identity, sexuality</a>, interests, work, and more. Subscribers can choose to remain anonymous displaying only their username, or they can share their profile with the creators they follow. </p>

      <p>Published content can be shared with an entire database, or segmented into subscriber groups determined by the creator.
      In addition to core content, creators have the option to produce one-off, collectible digital products that can be <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/nft/#minting-nfts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minted as NFTs</a> and sold for much higher prices, with the added benefit of distributing attractive royalties to the creator each time the NFT is onsold. A blockchain ledger stores proof of ownership of the NFT along with its transactional history, making the collectible’s provenance transparent and accurate. By leveraging blockchain technology, NFTs not only create more lucrative revenue streams for creators but also serve to limit unauthorised duplication of content. Users will use the Metamask crypto wallet browser extension to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and manage their NFTs.</p>

      <p>Robust identification and age-verification measures protect against nefarious online activity within the platform, with the view to increasing these measures in the future by introducing NFTs to the identification process. This will allow creators to assign an NFT to their SELF SRVCE identity as a sort of digital DNA, preventing the generation of sham profiles and deep fakes that attempt to produce counterfeit content. Until such a time when cryptocurrency is powered entirely by renewable energy, SELF SRVCE commits to offsetting 100% of the carbon footprint generated by NFT minting via the platform.</p>

      <p>SELF SRVCE's fees are competitive compared with popular cam sites that retain up to 70% of creator earnings, with a commitment to keeping fees as low as is viable (under the 20% mark).</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Tools & Technology&mdash;</h2>
      <br>
      <p>SELF SRVCE will be developed as a web application using Amazon Web Service (AWS) as its selected cloud vendor. The app will be developed for Android and IOS, requiring programming languages and frameworks that transgress independent smartphone platforms. At this stage, Google’s ‘Flutter’ is the preferred framework meaning the app will be developed using Dart and C++. Flutter’s UI toolkit is able to follow platform-specific rules without the need for additional coding making it an attractive option for cross-platform development, and Dart is an increasingly adopted language that is relatively easy to learn. Cloud Firestore will be used to ensure state changes are automatically updated in the backend. </p>

      <p>The Platform will engage a BaaS provider rather than developing its own server-side architecture and will initially use Parse, chosen for its generous basic plan which is free to use, with the potential to upgrade or change providers as necessary. Git and Github will be used for version control and collaborative programming, while Jira will serve as the preferred issue tracking software.</p>

      <p>In terms of security, SELF SRVCE will leverage Stripe’s AES-256 encryption to secure payment information, so too Ethereum’s ECDSA cryptography for blockchain payments. For in-app messaging, SELF SRVCE will implement end-to-end encryption as advised by its security personnel and intends to investigate Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256 combinations to secure communications within the platform.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Skills Required&mdash;</h2>
      <br>
      <p>SELF SRVCE requires full-stack web app developers proficient in multiple programming languages, primarily Dart and C++, as well as developers experienced in Solidity, the language used to develop smart contracts that run on Ethereum and to deploy NFTs. Expertise in agile/scrum methodologies is needed, as well as UI, UX, and front-end development. Understanding version control best practices is a must, ideally Git and Github. Aptitude in Figma and general graphic design skills are highly valued. </p>

      <p>In addition to developers, SELF SRVCE requires marketing personnel with experience in Google Ads and analytics, Facebook Ads, marketing research, consumer trends, brand positioning, and SEO/SEM best practices. Proficiency with Google Search Console, Analytics and Tag Manager required, as well as Facebook Business Manager and the Adobe suite.</p>

      <p>SELF SRVCE will also require a network & security specialist to ensure infrastructure is working at all times and to maintain ongoing security measures.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>Outcome&mdash;</h2>
      <br>
      <p>SELF SRVCE constitutes an immense impact on the content subscription service domain by driving wider adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency payments. It offers a unified tech answer for creators wanting to break into the NFT space alongside their existing content production endeavours without the need for multiple exchanges and interfaces, all while representing a genuinely lucrative revenue stream.</p>

      <p>SELF SRVCE’s impact for SWs is profound, particularly those in countries where legislation pertaining to their protection is underdeveloped, allowing individuals to accept private, anonymous payments for their services thus diminishing the risk for individuals to be “outed” and subsequently vilified. With banks and Fintechs minimising available avenues for SWs to make a living and popular adult platforms taking astronomical fees, SELF SRVCE redefines value in a traditionally exploitative space by providing a safe, cost-effective, user-friendly solution that fosters a community of diversity and inclusivity.</p>
