      <h2>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&mdash;</h2>
      <h3>INFJ-T</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator attempts to break down an individual’s disposition by looking at how they absorb information, how they energise, how they make decisions, and how they organise their lives. These are broken down into 4 dichotomous scales&mdash;introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving, respectively. </p>
      <p>My results indicate introversion, an intuitive information-gathering style, emotion-based decision making, and a preference for structure and organisation in my environment. Dubbed “The Advocate”, 16 Personalities describes individuals of this combination as creative problem-solvers with the ability to accurately read people’s true feelings through compassion and keen intuition. Advocates are inspiring communicators who speak and write with a conviction that can be quite persuasive. They prefer to succeed to the benefit of those around them, never to the detriment of others. Some weaknesses of the Advocate profile are a sensitivity to criticism, difficulty opening up and asking for help, and a sometimes debilitating perfectionism. </p>

      <p>Professionally, Advocates flourish when their work is meaningful and in alignment with their personal ethos, values, and principles. They’re creative and resourceful, and resilient when dealing with difficult personalities. They detest conflict but have a knack for diffusing it. In managerial roles, Advocates prefer to empower their subordinates and arm them with the tools they need to succeed rather than micromanaging people. Ideas and visions come easily to them, however, they often struggle with repetitive work and are less motivated by the task-based banalities required to achieve the greater goal. Advocates are often inclined to explore the through lines of generally unrelated fields and tend to create interesting hybrid careers for themselves.</p>

      <h2>&nbsp; VARK&mdash;</h2>
      <h3>AK, Type Two</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The VARK model categorises an individual's learning styles into 4 modalities&mdash;visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic&mdash;pertaining to how they best absorb information. </p>

      <p>My results show a multimodal inclination towards auditory and kinesthetic learning styles. Auditory learners digest information that is heard or spoken with a preference for group discussions, lectures, talking things over, as well as some informal writing methods that are formatted colloquially. Kinesthetic learners value implementation that is connected to reality, favouring demonstrations and simulations. VARK Type Two individuals work best when they’ve gathered information from both of their preferred learning modalities and often take more time exploring subject matter which can appear as procrastination or inefficiency but generally leads to a more in-depth comprehension of the material.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>&nbsp; DISC&mdash;</h2>
      <h3>Type S</h3>
      <br>
      <p>DISC is a behavioural assessment tool designed to provide insights into how an individual acts and reacts to various circumstances, relative to the styles of those around them (particularly in the workplace), and begets a deeper understanding of the individual and their associates. It categorises individuals into 4 segments&mdash;dominance, influence, steadiness, and conscientiousness.</p>

      <p>My results indicate a strong egalitarian inclination and a desire to cultivate a supportive, inclusive environment for teammates to flourish in. Type S individuals are dependable, reliable, strong communicators who utilise compassion and diplomacy in adversity and prefer to diffuse conflict with patience and understanding. They’re natural collaborators and strive for the overall success of the team rather than advancing their individual endeavours. These types can be indecisive and over-accommodating, often to their own and the team’s detriment, which can ultimately have the opposite effect of their intentions if not kept in check. Being extremely empathetic people, they often gloss over problems and avoid calling out the inadequacies of their colleagues in an attempt to keep the peace, leading to setbacks down the line.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>The Results&mdash;</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Overall, the results feel reasonably accurate and are consistent across all three psychometric models. Based on these outcomes, it’s clear that my learning style and general disposition lend themselves to more visionary roles in highly collaborative environments where problem-solving and organisation are key requirements. </p>

      <p>As I favour a combination of discussions and a hands-on approach to absorbing information, I feel it is imperative for me to prioritise on-site, team-based working environments over remote, solitary work. My results indicate an aversion to repetitive tasks, therefore developer roles are not really suitable for me. Although I do wish to further my programming skills and play a key role in app development in the future, ideally these would be applied in a more fundamental sense through Project Lead roles where I’m able to manage and collaborate with a team of highly technical personnel.</p>

      <p>In a team-based environment, the results suggest that I’ll feel quite at home collaborating with superiors, colleagues and subordinates alike and will excel in maintaining interpersonal relationships, diffusing conflict, and helping my teammates succeed in a supportive manner. </p>

      <p>When forming a team, I’d be looking for individuals to complement my strengths, meaning I’d need highly technical colleagues who are able to produce specific, consistent work. Being one to occasionally gloss over problems in order to keep the peace, more direct and decisive personality types would be beneficial as workmates. As someone who is multimodal in their approach to learning and therefore slower, I’d need executional colleagues alongside me who are efficient and able to assist with meeting impending deadlines.</p>

      <p>While these results are insightful, I am hyper-aware of psychological phenomena such as the Barnum Effect, whereby individuals exhibit a tendency to attribute greater accuracy to personal diagnostics than is actually present (Layne 1978), and social-desirability bias, which causes individuals to answer questions in a way that will be regarded approvingly by others (Larson 2018). With this in mind, I don’t intend to make any life-altering decisions based on the results, rather, I plan to apply some basic empirical observation to remain cognisant of the overarching themes and regularly reflect on whether they ring true throughout my education and career.</p>
