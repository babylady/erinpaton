<h1>MY BACKGROUND<h1>
<br>
<h2>About Me&mdash;</h2>

<body>
<br><p>I’m Erin Paton and I’m currently based in Byron Bay, NSW, Australia. Originally from Sydney, I relocated for a change of pace and to get closer to nature. Most of my weekends are spent hiking, exploring waterfalls, or at the beach. Currently, I’m fluent in English but I have a passion for French culture and intend to study the language up to C-level. (Only after I’ve knocked over a few programming languages!) </p>
<p>Something about me that often surprises people is my interest in spiders and snakes (and all animals!). Growing up surrounded by bushland, I was captivated by the natural world&mdash;I loved to identify and document all the wildlife in my area and would often bring my friends home with me for show and tell, much to my mother’s dismay. As a teenager, I landed my first job with a zoo renowned for its milking programs that supply all of Australia’s funnel-web and snake antivenom. Here I was able to expand my knowledge outside of my postcode and into exotic species, as well as learning about wildlife and habitat conservation. </p>
<br>
<h2>Education&mdash;</h2>
<br>
<p>Since finishing my high school certificate, I’ve taken an autodidactic approach to learning concurrent with my respective vocation, however, emerging technologies have inspired a personal expedition into the world of IT and through undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology (and subsequent specialisms) with RMIT, I hope to explore verticals such as Cybersecurity, Blockchain Technology, Digital Health, and other nascent areas. </p>
<p>I chose RMIT for a few reasons, the first of which is the university’s global opportunities. Travel is important to me and I hope to take advantage of RMIT’s exchange program to develop my studies abroad. Secondly, a number of colleagues and friends in my network are RMIT alumni, all of whom speak highly of the support offered at the university which is very important to me being new to tertiary education. Lastly, RMIT was the highest-ranking university offering my preferred degree via Open Universities Australia at the time of my enrollment.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<h1>MY CAREER<h1>

  <br>
  <h2>Where it Began&mdash;</h2>
  <br>
  <p>My first significant brush with technology came about unexpectedly whilst starting a new job at a marketing agency that I quickly learned was in fact a technology company specialising in Marketing Tech&mdash;a sector I wasn’t even aware of in my green and growing years. With the company providing a fully-automated end-to-end marketing service, I was required to demonstrate a nuanced understanding of various internal and EAS software, maintain active involvement in growth and scale endeavours, develop marketing stack architecture, formulate/adapt products concurrent with emerging technologies, as well as work closely with developers and IT specialists (without whom the aforementioned would not be possible). I certainly got more than I bargained for but the simple misinterpretation of a recruitment ad facilitated valuable insights into some of the applications of information technology that perhaps a more executional marketing position would not have afforded and I feel fortunate to have stumbled into the world of technology as a result.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Interest in IT&mdash;</h2>
  <br>
  <p>As my background demonstrates, my interest in IT revolves around enhancing the way we do business and interface with the world. In particular, exploring the intersect between information technology and traditionally low-tech fields that rely on less sophisticated methods to operate. Art, Design, Psychology, Health & Wellness, and Sexual Education are all areas that are important to me and while I don’t have plans to further my education in these fields, the possibility of exploring their convergence with emerging technologies is something that excites me&mdash;I’d love to play a role in increasing the accessibility and interoperability of these spaces in some way throughout the course of my career in IT. By developing my skills in various programming languages (Java, Dart, C++), learning how to use collaborative project management tools such as Jira, understanding integrated development environments such as Intelij, and leaning on resources such as Stack Overflow, I hope to be involved in developing valuable applications that enhance the way users interact with products, systems, and services.
  As a graduate, I will have acquired the techniques and methodologies fundamental to forging a career in IT and remaining agile in an ever-evolving landscape. Web & application design, programming, project management, troubleshooting, and ethical hacking are some of the hard skills I expect to attain throughout the degree, as well as problem-solving, adaptability, critical thinking, teamwork, communication, and more.
</p>

<br>
<h2>Ideal Job&mdash;</h2>
<br>
<p><b><a href="https://cryptojobslist.com/jobs/project-manager-web3-marketplace-at-minty-art-remote">Project Manager at Minty Art</b></a>
<br><br>
<p>This position demands strong communication and organisational skills in order to manage projects from ideation to completion, requiring the incumbent to coordinate staff, resources and technologies in order to deliver. As well as setting timelines and ensuring deliverables are met, this position calls for influential leadership skills that build relationships with the project team in a manner that nurtures their strengths and empowers them to succeed. This role represents an opportunity for me to demonstrate my management and problem-solving skills in a field that I’m excited about. Being a huge advocate for democratising the art world, as well as having a keen interest in blockchain technology and the opportunities NFTs present for the art ecosystem, this feels like the perfect position for me to flourish in. As my psychometric diagnostics demonstrate, and as I can personally attest, it is imperative for me to work in fields that align with my personal values, and this position more than fulfills that need.</p>
<p>Project Management positions require analysis expertise and an understanding of the effort, cost, and scope of the project. The position requires a strong grasp of budgeting, planning, and management best practices, and thus general business acumen is valuable, as well as a comprehensive understanding of blockchain technology and its implications, token economy, NFTs, and decentralised finance. The job description calls for excellent verbal and written communication skills and experience with various communication and collaborative organisational tools. The successful candidate will preferably hold a relevant Bachelor's degree or adequate experience in the field.
Having worked in project lead and managerial roles previously, I understand the fundamental principles required to coordinate a team successfully with key milestones in mind. I have extensive experience with Asana, Hubspot and Discord as called for in the advertisement, as well as communicating with key stakeholders within the tech space. My comprehension of blockchain technology is developing with plenty of room for improvement - this is an area I’m researching and learning about on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In order to succeed in this role, I plan to complete a Bachelor of IT and continue to develop my knowledge in the crypto space by taking courses and applying my learning in real-world scenarios. This may require me to take on internships to gain hands-on experience working with NFTs and digital art curators. In addition, I’ll need to take steps in understanding Web3 infrastructure which will require a lot of reading, tutorials, and discussions with professionals.
</p>
<br><br><br><br>


<h1>PSYCHOMETRICS<h1>
<br>
<h2>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&mdash;</h2>
<h2>INFJ-T</h2>
<br>
<p>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator attempts to break down an individual’s disposition by looking at how they absorb information, how they energise, how they make decisions, and how they organise their lives. These are broken down into 4 dichotomous scales@mdash;introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving, respectively. </p>
<p>My results indicate introversion, an intuitive information-gathering style, emotion-based decision making, and a preference for structure and organisation in my environment. Dubbed “The Advocate”, 16 Personalities describes individuals of this combination as creative problem-solvers with the ability to accurately read people’s true feelings through compassion and keen intuition. Advocates are inspiring communicators who speak and write with a conviction that can be quite persuasive. They prefer to succeed to the benefit of those around them, never to the detriment of others. Some weaknesses of the Advocate profile are a sensitivity to criticism, difficulty opening up and asking for help, and a sometimes debilitating perfectionism. </p>

<p>Professionally, Advocates flourish when their work is meaningful and in alignment with their personal ethos, values, and principles. They’re creative and resourceful, and resilient when dealing with difficult personalities. They detest conflict but have a knack for diffusing it. In managerial roles, Advocates prefer to empower their subordinates and arm them with the tools they need to succeed rather than micromanaging people. Ideas and visions come easily to them, however, they often struggle with repetitive work and are less motivated by the task-based banalities required to achieve the greater goal. Advocates are often inclined to explore the through lines of generally unrelated fields and tend to create interesting hybrid careers for themselves.</p>
<br>

<h2>VARK&mdash;</h2>
<h2>AK, Type Two</h2>
<br>
<p>The VARK model categorises an individual's learning styles into 4 modalities&mdash;visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic&mdash;pertaining to how they best absorb information. </p>

<p>My results show a multimodal inclination towards auditory and kinesthetic learning styles. Auditory learners digest information that is heard or spoken with a preference for group discussions, lectures, talking things over, as well as some informal writing methods that are formatted colloquially. Kinesthetic learners value implementation that is connected to reality, favouring demonstrations and simulations. VARK Type Two individuals work best when they’ve gathered information from both of their preferred learning modalities and often take more time exploring subject matter which can appear as procrastination or inefficiency but generally leads to a more in-depth comprehension of the material.</p>
<br>

<h2>DISC&mdash;</h2>
<h2>Type S</h2>
<br>
<p>DISC is a behavioural assessment tool designed to provide insights into how an individual acts and reacts to various circumstances, relative to the styles of those around them (particularly in the workplace), and begets a deeper understanding of the individual and their associates. It categorises individuals into 4 segments&mdash;dominance, influence, steadiness, and conscientiousness.</p>

<p>My results indicate a strong egalitarian inclination and a desire to cultivate a supportive, inclusive environment for teammates to flourish in. Type S individuals are dependable, reliable, strong communicators who utilise compassion and diplomacy in adversity and prefer to diffuse conflict with patience and understanding. They’re natural collaborators and strive for the overall success of the team rather than advancing their individual endeavours. These types can be indecisive and over-accommodating, often to their own and the team’s detriment, which can ultimately have the opposite effect of their intentions if not kept in check. Being extremely empathetic people, they often gloss over problems and avoid calling out the inadequacies of their colleagues in an attempt to keep the peace, leading to setbacks down the line.</p>
<br>

<h2>The Results&mdash;</h2>
<br>
<p>Overall, the results feel reasonably accurate and are consistent across all three psychometric models. Based on these outcomes, it’s clear that my learning style and general disposition lend themselves to more visionary roles in highly collaborative environments where problem-solving and organisation are key requirements. </p>

<p>As I favour a combination of discussions and a hands-on approach to absorbing information, I feel it is imperative for me to prioritise on-site, team-based working environments over remote, solitary work. My results indicate an aversion to repetitive tasks, therefore developer roles are not really suitable for me. Although I do wish to further my programming skills and play a key role in app development in the future, ideally these would be applied in a more fundamental sense through Project Lead roles where I’m able to manage and collaborate with a team of highly technical personnel.</p>

<p>In a team-based environment, the results suggest that I’ll feel quite at home collaborating with superiors, colleagues and subordinates alike and will excel in maintaining interpersonal relationships, diffusing conflict, and helping my teammates succeed in a supportive manner. </p>

<p>When forming a team, I’d be looking for individuals to complement my strengths, meaning I’d need highly technical colleagues who are able to produce specific, consistent work. Being one to occasionally gloss over problems in order to keep the peace, more direct and decisive personality types would be beneficial as workmates. As someone who is multimodal in their approach to learning and therefore slower, I’d need executional colleagues alongside me who are efficient and able to assist with meeting impending deadlines.</p>

<p>While these results are insightful, I am hyper-aware of psychological phenomena such as the Barnum Effect, whereby individuals exhibit a tendency to attribute greater accuracy to personal diagnostics than is actually present (Layne 1978), and social-desirability bias, which causes individuals to answer questions in a way that will be regarded approvingly by others (Larson 2018). With this in mind, I don’t intend to make any life-altering decisions based on the results, rather, I plan to apply some basic empirical observation to remain cognisant of the overarching themes and regularly reflect on whether they ring true throughout my education and career.</p>
<br><br><br><br>

<h1>MY PROJECT<h1>
<br><br>
<h2>Overview&mdash;</h2>
<br>
<p>Self Service is a web-based subscription application facilitating the sale of regular digital content to subscribers, with the option for creators to mint and sell one-off digital items as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/nft/#what-are-nfts">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a>. With a strong emphasis on advocating for a shift in cultural norms around sex positivity, the platform aims to provide a safe and profitable environment for sex workers (SW), adult entertainers, and cam models to connect with their fans and share their content securely. Cognisant of the barriers to accepting traditional payments for sexually-oriented services, all one-off transactions can be made in cryptocurrency rather than traditional fiat with a view to moving recurring payments entirely to crypto as technology in this area develops. </p>
<br>

<h2>Motivation&mdash;</h2>
<br>
<p>Self Service recognises that the right for SWs to express themselves with autonomy remains under duress globally (Amnesty International 2015). As banks (SBS News 2019) and mainstream payment processors continue to disenchfranchise SWs by severing ties with popular sites and refusing to process payments (Business Insider 2019), Self Service sees a growing need for innovation in the adult entertainment space that will allow creators to continue to make a living. COVID-19 has undoubtedly impacted consumer habits and significantly augmented the subscription-based economy (Tzuo 2020) and with the subsequent rise in popularity of virtual content, Self Service has identified an opportunity to meet the growing demands of online users and the needs of creators alike. Whilst supporting the adult industry is a key driver, Self Service is an inclusive community and is accessible to anyone over 18 looking to trade their digital content for cryptocurrency, from educational courses to live-streams, to selfies.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Description&mdash;</h2>
<br>
<p>Subscription fees and content frequency are customised at the creator-level, with the option for creators to accept payments on a monthly or yearly basis. Monthly recurring payments are processed in fiat, while the yearly up-front payment option can be accepted in cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum), enabling users to expand their crypto portfolio whilst growing their fan base. Seamless integration with Stripe allows no-fuss recurring payments with the platform automatically responding to payment defaults using customisable triggers so creators can spend less time chasing payments and more time producing valuable content. Self Service’s integrated email marketing tools enable creators to send one-off blasts to push new and soon-to-be-released products, send rewards and promotions to their fans, and set up conditional email sequences based on their subscriber’s activity to keep their audience informed and engaged. Additional features include paid conversations with individual subscribers and one on one content sharing, allowing users to monetise bespoke experiences in addition to their core service and foster closer connections with their fans.
</p>
<p>Each user creates their own personal profile, publicising as much or as little basic information as they wish, with options to display preferred <a href="https://genderminorities.com/database/glossary-transgender/">pronouns, gender identity, sexuality</a>, interests, work, and more. Subscribers can choose to remain anonymous displaying only their username, or they can share their profile with the creators they follow. </p>

<p>Published content can be shared with an entire database, or segmented into subscriber groups determined by the creator.
In addition to core content, creators have the option to produce one-off, collectible digital products that can be <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/nft/#minting-nfts">minted as NFTs</a> and sold for much higher prices, with the added benefit of distributing attractive royalties to the creator each time the NFT is onsold. A blockchain ledger stores proof of ownership of the NFT along with its transactional history, making the collectible’s provenance transparent and accurate. By leveraging blockchain technology, NFTs not only create more lucrative revenue streams for creators but also serve to limit unauthorised duplication of content. Users will use the Metamask crypto wallet browser extension to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and manage their NFTs.</p>

<p>Robust identification and age-verification measures protect against nefarious online activity within the platform, with the view to increasing these measures in the future by introducing NFTs to the identification process. This will allow creators to assign an NFT to their Self Service identity as a sort of digital DNA, preventing the generation of sham profiles and deep fakes that attempt to produce counterfeit content. Until such a time when cryptocurrency is powered entirely by renewable energy, Self Service commits to offsetting 100% of the carbon footprint generated by NFT minting via the platform.</p>

<p>Self Service’s fees are competitive compared with popular cam sites that retain up to 70% of creator earnings, with a commitment to keeping fees as low as is viable (under the 20% mark).</p>
<br>

<h2>Tools & Technology&mdash;</h2>
<br>
<p>Self Service will be developed as a web application using Amazon Web Service (AWS) as its selected cloud vendor. The app will be developed for Android and IOS, requiring programming languages and frameworks that transgress independent smartphone platforms. At this stage, Google’s ‘Flutter’ is the preferred framework meaning the app will be developed using Dart and C++. Flutter’s UI toolkit is able to follow platform-specific rules without the need for additional coding making it an attractive option for cross-platform development, and Dart is an increasingly adopted language that is relatively easy to learn. Cloud Firestore will be used to ensure state changes are automatically updated in the backend. </p>

<p>The Platform will engage a BaaS provider rather than developing its own server-side architecture and will initially use Parse, chosen for its generous basic plan which is free to use, with the potential to upgrade or change providers as necessary. Git and Github will be used for version control and collaborative programming, while Jira will serve as the preferred issue tracking software.</p>

<p>In terms of security, Self Service will leverage Stripe’s AES-256 encryption to secure payment information, so too Ethereum’s ECDSA cryptography for blockchain payments. For in-app messaging, Self Service will implement end-to-end encryption as advised by its security personnel and intends to investigate Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256 combinations to secure communications within the platform.</p>
<br>

<h2>Skills Required&mdash;</h2>
<br>
<p>Self Service requires full-stack web app developers proficient in multiple programming languages, primarily Dart and C++, as well as developers experienced in Solidity, the language used to develop smart contracts that run on Ethereum and to deploy NFTs. Expertise in agile/scrum methodologies is needed, as well as UI, UX, and front-end development. Understanding version control best practices is a must, ideally Git and Github. Aptitude in Figma and general graphic design skills are highly valued. </p>

<p>In addition to developers, Self Service requires marketing personnel with experience in Google Ads and analytics, Facebook Ads, marketing research, consumer trends, brand positioning, and SEO/SEM best practices. Proficiency with Google Search Console, Analytics and Tag Manager required, as well as Facebook Business Manager and the Adobe suite.</p>

<p>Self Service will also require a network & security specialist to ensure infrastructure is working at all times and to maintain ongoing security measures.</p>
<br>

<h2>Outcome&mdash;</h2>
<br>
<p>Self Service constitutes an immense impact on the content subscription service domain by driving wider adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency payments. It offers a unified tech answer for creators wanting to break into the NFT space alongside their existing content production endeavours without the need for multiple exchanges and interfaces, all while representing a genuinely lucrative revenue stream.</p>

<p>Self Service’s impact for SWs is profound, particularly those in countries where legislation pertaining to their protection is underdeveloped, allowing individuals to accept private, anonymous payments for their services thus diminishing the risk for individuals to be “outed” and subsequently vilified. With banks and Fintechs minimising available avenues for SWs to make a living and popular adult platforms taking astronomical fees, Self Service redefines value in a traditionally exploitative space by providing a safe, cost-effective, user-friendly solution that fosters a community of diversity and inclusivity.</p>
