<h2>I'm Erin&mdash;</h2>



<br><p>Originally from Sydney, NSW, Australia, I relocated to Byron Bay for a change of pace and to get closer to nature. Most of my weekends are spent hiking, exploring waterfalls, or at the beach. Currently, I’m fluent in English but I have a passion for French culture and intend to study the language up to C-level. (Only after I’ve knocked over a few programming languages!) </p>
<p>Something about me that often surprises people is my interest in spiders and snakes (and all animals!). Growing up surrounded by bushland, I was captivated by the natural world&mdash;I loved to identify and document all the wildlife in my area and would often bring my friends home with me for show and tell, much to my mother’s dismay. As a teenager, I landed my first job with a zoo renowned for its milking programs that supply all of Australia’s funnel-web and snake antivenom. Here I was able to expand my knowledge outside of my postcode and into exotic species, as well as learning about wildlife and habitat conservation. </p>

<h2>Education&mdash;</h2>
<br>
<p>Since finishing my high school certificate, I’ve taken an autodidactic approach to learning concurrent with my respective vocation, however, emerging technologies have inspired a personal expedition into the world of IT and through undertaking a Bachelor of Information Technology (and subsequent specialisms) with RMIT, I hope to explore verticals such as Cybersecurity, Blockchain Technology, Digital Health, and other nascent areas. </p>
<p>I chose RMIT for a few reasons, the first of which is the university’s global opportunities. Travel is important to me and I hope to take advantage of RMIT’s exchange program to develop my studies abroad. Secondly, a number of colleagues and friends in my network are RMIT alumni, all of whom speak highly of the support offered at the university which is very important to me being new to tertiary education. Lastly, RMIT was the highest-ranking university offering my preferred degree via Open Universities Australia at the time of my enrollment.</p>
